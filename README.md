# FFRK Helper
Basic app (hosted by Streamit at https://share.streamlit.io/amasini90/ffrk/main/) based on a custom csv file with the list of relics available in the game. 
The app assigns weights to relics and compute scores, to give informed advice on which realm/element improve first.
Suggested parties with the best 5 characters can also be composed, based on the available relics for a given realm/element.
